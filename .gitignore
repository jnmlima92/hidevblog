# Ignore bundler config.
/hidevapp/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/hidevapp/log/*
/hidevapp/tmp/*
/hidevapp/!/log/.keep
/hidevapp/!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/hidevapp/tmp/pids/*
/hidevapp/!/tmp/pids/
/hidevapp/!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/hidevapp/storage/*
/hidevapp/!/storage/.keep
